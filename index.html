        <!--This is Question Two-->
        <p>
            Full Stack Development program has been quite interesting and educating. A journey started on the last thursday of July 2022, keeps getting more captivating and soul lifting. I am happy I embarked on this journey, most especially being part of the CapacityBay family and community. Anyone can decide to do a personal study, which is still good, but learning with a team opens one up to different types of knowledge, ideas and these make what is learnt a lasting knowledge. A lot of things interest me on this journey, even though we are just beginning, and one of the intriguing thing is the patience my group Faculty uses to teach us. He amazes me with his calmness and ability to carry everyone along, making sure nobody was left behind. Our classes for that reason has been a smooth ride so far and I really appreciate him and other Faculties. I know we are still scratching the surface, but Iâ€™m hopeful and determined to work hard and get to the finish line.  We are now on HTML, more languages are still in the cooler; JavaScript, CSS, etc.,   I believe we (students) are expectant and excited. I look forward to enjoying everything.
